SyS - C1aga
- I am currently working on Hybrid Analytics, running & inspecting VSTs, Plugins & "Anti-Virus" Softwares. 

- Learning C++ & C - Expanding my knowledge!

- I'm open for any quires, or projects relating to Analyising, or creating anti-virus frameworks. (Mind I am still very shit at frameworks and analysing. Don't expect a yes if its large-scale projects.) I am also open for any support, related to minecraft configuration. (DO NOT contact me about pterodactyl. It's a shitty panel, and I love it.)

- You can reach me at sysbusinessmail@gmail.com or sys#4882


Let's clean the Web, shall we?
